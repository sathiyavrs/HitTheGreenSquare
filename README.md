# Hit The Green Square
Alpha Version of the Festember Game I want to make.

Controls:

WASD or Arrow Keys to control the paddle horizontally and vertically.
Q & E or Z & C to control the paddle's clockwise and Anti-clockwise movement.

Any mouse button in the specified Direction will Fire the ball from the paddle.

The ball loses health as it hits objects.
The Brown Enemies are destroyed in one hit.
The White ones are not.
Well, Hit The Green Square!

# To Play

(It Should Work)
Download and extract the entire project and create a Python SimpleHTTPServer in that Directory.
Run the index.html file afterwards.
